/* 
This script is meant to be run by the npm startup script in package.json. It's purpose is to monitor a LoRa gateway
connected to The Things Network for packets received. Those packets will then be posted to a json-server API 
utilizing express. In the future, there should be the capability to get the user name from the packet in order 
to seperate the data accordingly, but for now, a single use case will suffice for prototyping purposes.
